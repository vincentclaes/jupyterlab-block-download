# Block Download JupyterLab

got inspiration from here: https://ujjwalbhardwaj.me/post/disable-download-button-on-the-sagemaker-jupyter-notebook/

# Setup

- build container in VSCODE
- jupyter lab --port 5000
- configure api key ans set a password
- login 
- upload a file and try to download it -> it should FAIL!
